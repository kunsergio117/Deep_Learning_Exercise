    "You are given a dataset with about 1000 English tweets on Singapore (`singapore.csv`) obtained for the period of Jan 2022 to Mar 2022. Your task is to **produce a function to perform text preprocessing of the text in the tweets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in class, text pre-processing is focused at preparing the data into a more ideal form - particularly a more general form so that patterns can be derived. They will often improve performance of the machine learning (ML) models significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is especially important for tweets as tweets tend to contain many *out of vocabulary* tokens such as *twitter user handle*, *numbers*, *urls*, *emoticons*, etc. Without performing text pre-processing, the ML models would have a much harder time to generalize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some useful NLP application working on tweets includes building a text classifier that can classify whether a tweet is supposed to be under the *singapore*, *sports*, *business*, etc category."
