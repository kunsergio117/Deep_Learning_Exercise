# Deep_Learning_Exercise

## Description
Jupyter notebook files running some case studies that I have done on deep learning.

### 

### IMDB dataset: 
In this project I review and put into practice what I have learnt in how to utilize deep learning module tensorflow on text samples.

The IMDB dataset has a set of 50,000 highly-polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.

The IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras. It has already been preprocessed: the reviews (sequences of words)


## Getting Started
### pip install instructions
Ensure that the following lines are run for the program to function.
This pip installs all the required packages listed in requirements.txt.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

* This version was developed using Python 3.11, and will run best in this version (because this is the case for tensorflow).
* Please confirm that the required modules are installed to use this program, which are contained in required.txt

### Installing

* python 3.11
* jupyter

### Executing program
* The file Movie_Reviews_Practice.ipynb is a jupyter notebook as the individual code blocks are very time intensive to run.

* If there is an error, please refer to the above required packages and programs in order for the program to run smoothly.

## Help

Please refer to the dependencies section above and ensure that all python versions, and library versions are as listed.
